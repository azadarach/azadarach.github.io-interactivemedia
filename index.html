        <h3>Week Two Questions:</h3>

        <button class="collapsible">1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p> The website I chose: <a href="https://orb.farm/">Max Bittker's Orb.farm</a> <br><br>
              
              - As soon as the website loaded, I clicked the information button, because I wanted to know how I could use it. 
 
             <br><br> - I read about the different elements by clicking (+) on Elements and then (+) on all of the different classifications before I read through them all quickly.
               
             <br><br> - Once I knew a little bit about everything, I clicked the X button at the top right of the information pop-up.
               
             <br><br> - The element was already set to sand, which I assumed would make me draw sand, so I directed my cursor over to the bowl/tank/terrarium and clicked, which made me draw sand which fell to the bottom of the tank. 
               
             <br><br> - I then clicked and held down, which created more sand that fell to the bottom. 
               
             <br><br> - The sand was uneven so I drew across the bottom of the tank to create a flat base of sand. 
               
             <br><br> - I then clicked on the water element and brought my cursor back over to the tank and started filling it up with water about halfway. I did this by clicking and moving my mouse to where I wanted water. 
               
             <br><br> - I then clicked on the grass element, which I knew I needed to create oxygen in my ecosystem, and drew a layer of grass over the sand. 
               
             <br><br> - I then clicked on the fish, and clicked in the water I created to add some fish. I also clicked on the goldfish and added one, and then time was over. 
              
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The first thing I paid attention to when the website first loaded was the CO2/O2 meter in the top right corner. I was confused as to why it was there, which made me click on the information button to better understand what the website was about and what I was meant to be doing/how Max Bittker wanted me to interact with his work. I figured out that I was meant to create an ecosystem, and in an ecosystem you need the right balance of carbon-dioxide and oxygen. </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I spent the most time on adding elements to my ecosystem, I only had just over a minute after I read the instructions and understood a little about what I was meant to be doing to start creating my ecosystem, so I added sand, water, grass and fish. It made sense to spend most of my time creating and playing around. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I was mostly playing which involved a lot of clicking and drawing with my mouse. I did also read the information that was presented to me when I clicked the information button, but I wanted to play around with creating a small ecosystem so I thought I would spend most of my time on that. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>My impression is that the website is there for fun but also will educate the people who interact with it. I also think on a bit of a deeper level this could be a commentary on the world and how us humans have no idea how to take care of our planet and with human interaction all we do is destroy and change things that were working prior to our involvement. I believe it could be saying that if we try to create our own ecosystems, they will eventually fail. <br><br> Though, the information section tells you exactly how to create a functional ecosystem, so I think with a bit more further reading and research into how ecosystems operate and thrive, someone would be able to create one that works. A person who already knows a lot about this subject would most likely thrive with this interactive experience, unfortunately, that person is not me. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">6) How does the experience communicate its primary goal?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The first line on the information page is “This is a virtual ecosystem where different species of creature can live, grow and die as part of a self-contained food chain.” which told me that the intended purpose was to create an ecosystem that could work on its own. The buttons on the pop-up in the top right corner told me that this website was an interactive game-like experience, while the information conveyed that it was also educational. I think Max Bittker’s work is both a game and an educational experience. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="collapsible">7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I think the intention is that you spend quite a bit of time creating an ecosystem that works and keeps everything alive. I think a single interaction should probably be about 30 minutes to an hour, as there is a lot to figure out, because you need to keep that oxygen/carbon dioxide meter in the green. I think it is definitely an experience you can return to to keep your ecosystem going, but it is not a necessity. </p>
          </div>

        <h3>Week Three Questions:</h3>

        <button class="collapsible">8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>In my website, there are buttons that say ‘Water’, ‘Sand’ and ‘Fish’, which, when chosen and clicked inside of the ecosystem bubble, create things that look like water, sand and fish respectively. When beginning to interact with my website, it was easy to infer what these buttons did and what would happen when I press and use them. I was not told explicitly what these buttons would do, but from past experiences with other similar games, I knew exactly the outcome I would have if I interacted with them. </p>
          </div>
        <button class="collapsible">9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The buttons tell me exactly what they do as they have a word on each button and an associated colour telling me what they do. There was only one button I did not know, Daphnia, which made me feel slightly uneasy until I read in ‘Info’ what it is and what it does. I think the buttons suggest that I should feel like I am creating something.</p>
          </div>
        <button class="collapsible">10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The most frustrating aspect of my interaction was that the water didn’t move like water should. I’m not exactly sure why this particular part was so frustrating to me, but when I added water to the inside of the circle/tank I remember I found myself quite annoyed that the water wasn’t flowing like I imagined it to. I think that small thing brought me out of the experience a little bit and made me a little frustrated. I think if the water flowed a little faster as I drew it I would have been much much happier with my overall experience. 
            </p>
          </div>
        <button class="collapsible">11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The most satisfying element of my interaction was how the information was set out when I clicked on the information button at the start of my interaction. The information wasn’t all there at once which would have intimidated me, but it was set out in nice little separated sections where I could click on the information I wanted in the moment and it expanded and told me what I wanted to know. When I was done with one piece of information I could just close it with the minus button and open the next piece of information. I quite enjoyed the way it was sorted. The way that the information was sorted was very cohesive and coherent and I appreciated that. 
            </p>
